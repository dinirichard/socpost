Learn the architecture of the project

The entire project is built under [**NX**](https://nx.dev/) to have a monorepo with multiple projects.\
\
Unlike other NX project, this project has one `.env` file that is shared between all the apps.\
It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.\
\
When deploying to websites like [**Railway**](https://railway.app/) or [**Heroku**](https://heroku.com/), you can use a shared environment variables for all the apps.

**At the moment it has 6 project:**

- **Backend** - NestJS based system

- **Workers** - NestJS based workers connected to a Redis Queue.

- **Cron** - NestJS scheduler to run cron jobs.

- **Frontend** - NextJS based control panel.

- **Docs** - Swimm based documentation website.

## **Architecture**

### Frontend

The frontend is built with [**Angular**](https://angular.dev/) and [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/).\
It works directly with the Backend to:

- Show analytics

- Schedule posts

- Manage users

### [**​**](https://docs.postiz.com/howitworks#backend)

### Backend

The backend is built with [**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/) with a basic architecture of controllers, services, repositories and dtos.\
\
It uses [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM to interact with the database.\
By default Prisma uses [**Postgres**](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database, but it can be easily changed to any other database since there are no native queries.\
\
It uses Redis to schedule posts and run background jobs.

### Cron

The backend is built with [**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with the backend.\
At the moment the use of the cron is:

- Refresh tokens from different social media platforms.

- Check for trending change every hour and inform users about it.

- Sync the amount of stars for every repository at the end of the day.

### Worker

The backend is built with [**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with the backend.\
At the moment the use of the worker is:

- Post scheduled posts to social media platforms.

- Perform multiple jobs coming from the cron.

### [**​**](https://docs.postiz.com/howitworks#docs)

### Docs

The documentation website is built with [Swimm](swimm.io).\
The reference in the documentation is being auto-generated by the backend and AI.
