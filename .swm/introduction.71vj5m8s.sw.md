Architecture

Gitroom is an [**NX monorepo**](https://nx.dev/) that contains a backend, a frontend, workers, cron jobs and the docs.\
\
Unlike other NX project, this project has one `.env` file that is shared between all the apps.\
It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.\
\
When deploying to websites like [**Railway**](https://railway.app/) or [**Heroku**](https://heroku.com/), you can use a shared environment variables for all the apps.

**It has four main components:**

- `frontend` - Angular control panel serving as the admin dashboard for the project.

- `backend` - NestJS backend that serves as the API for the frontend.
